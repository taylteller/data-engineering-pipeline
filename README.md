# Data Engineering Pipeline

## Project Summary
The purpose of this project is to create an ETL pipeline that wrangles data on immigration, demographics and environmental factors (specifically temperature), in order to be able to glean insights about what factors may make certain US destination popular for international visits. Example questions that business users may want answered include:
* Is there a correlation between a visitor's home temperature and the temperature of their chosen destination?
* Do people from certain countries prefer destination cities where certain ethnicities are better represented?
* Are particular destinations more popular with holders of visas of a certain type?

We'll be using Spark to process the data.

Please refer to the [very thoroughly documented Jupyter notebook](etl.ipynb) to see the pipeline in action.

This project serves as the capstone for the Udacity Data Engineering Nanodegree.
